Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need the following:

    An Azure subscription with permissions to create resources
    A Log Analytics workspace
    Some data sources to connect to Azure Sentinel

Step 1: Create a Log Analytics Workspace

Azure Sentinel uses Log Analytics workspaces to collect, store, and analyze security data. If you don't have a Log Analytics workspace already, you need to create one.

    Go to the Azure portal and sign in with your account.
    In the left-hand menu, click on "Create a resource".
    Search for "Log Analytics workspace" and select it.
    Choose the subscription, resource group, and name for your workspace. You can leave the default options for the other settings.
    Click "Review + create" and then "Create" to create the workspace.

Step 2: Connect Data Sources

Azure Sentinel can collect security data from a variety of sources, including Azure services, on-premises systems, and third-party solutions. To connect a data source, you need to create a connector.

    In the Azure portal, go to your Log Analytics workspace.
    In the left-hand menu, click on "Agents management".
    Click on the "Connect" button and select the data source you want to connect.
    Follow the instructions to complete the setup of the connector.

You can connect multiple data sources to Azure Sentinel to get a comprehensive view of your security posture.
Step 3: Create Analytics Rules

Azure Sentinel uses analytics rules to detect and alert on security incidents. You can create custom rules or use pre-built rules provided by Microsoft.

    In the Azure portal, go to your Log Analytics workspace.
    In the left-hand menu, click on "Analytics".
    Click on the "Create" button and select "Scheduled Query Rule" or "Alert Rule".
    Follow the instructions to create a rule. You can use the query language to write custom rules or select pre-built rules from the gallery.

Step 4: Monitor and Investigate Incidents

Once you have set up your Log Analytics workspace and created analytics rules, you can start monitoring security events in Azure Sentinel. When an incident is detected, you will receive an alert in the Azure portal or through email.

To investigate an incident, you can use the Azure Sentinel workspace to search and analyze security data. You can use the query language to write custom queries or use pre-built queries provided by Microsoft.
Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have shown you how to set up Azure Sentinel and start analyzing security events. With Azure Sentinel, you can get a comprehensive view of your security posture and respond to threats faster.
